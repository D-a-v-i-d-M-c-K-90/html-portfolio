<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, my name is David and I am a partially self taught web developer.  I have always had a pation for computers and IT,
  starting in my early days with video games on consoles such as the Sega Megadrive, then onto the Playstation 1 and eventually
  ending up on PC gaming.  From there my interest in computing began to blosum.

  While at University in Brighton, I met my now wife, and I veered off the IT track in pursuit of family life.  Eventually getting married,
  getting a job in a customer service role and moving back to Northern Ireland (after a lot of heavy persuasion), 
  I had started the family that I had sought out to.

  Fast forward, I had become comfortable in my career of office administration, but it wasn't challenging me.  So I made the decision to come
  back to IT once again.  After research I found that web development / software development was my main interest in the IT world.  So enroled in an online web developer
  course from Udemy and began my new journey back into the world if IT
