<h3>Lord of the Rings, Return of the King</h3>
<p>This movie is my favourite of the trilogy due to its massive fight scenes</p>

<h3>Hobbit, Battle of Five Armies</h3>
<p>This movie also has really great large scale battle scenes</p>

<h3>Grown Ups</h3>
<p>This is a great comedy movie, anything with Adam Sandler = funny</p>
